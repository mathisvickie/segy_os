# SegyOS

SegyOS is just protected mode application rather than standalone operating system because it lacks of many features that OS must have (mm, paging, multithreading...).
The motivation was to make self-sufficient application that runs from DOS/FREE-DOS and creates LFB (linear frame buffer) for demos made in pure assembly!
